#Project 5: Pattern Matching#

Both the file extension name and the text matching use regular expressions

User has to enter something from the terminal like:
	java Project5 C:\Users\tlh\Desktop\Project5\dir1 .java$ ".*[B|b]oolean.*"
	or
	java Project5 dir1 .txt$ .*public*.	(assuming you are already in C:\Users\tlh\Desktop\Project5\)

Also for some regular expressions you need to use quotation marks around the regex or the program won't run.
mostly longer ones with many different characters like " | ".
the error looks like this... bash: syntax error near unexpected token '('

All files in the "dir1" directory are only used to test the Project5.java program, and are not a part of the program.
