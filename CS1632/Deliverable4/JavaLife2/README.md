# JavaLife
A (deliberately inefficient) version of Conway's Game of Life

If you have never played with the Game of Life, you are in for a treat!  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life. <br />

Goal: There is a (deliberately) hidden inefficient method in this repo, which it is your job to find and refactor using VisualVM. <br />
