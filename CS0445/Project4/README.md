#Project 4: Boggle Solver#

This was a challenge to write a Boggle solver to find all the valid words in a given Boggle board, using a dictionary of 172,800 words. The goal was raw speed.
My approach used a prefix tree (trie) data structure to store the dictionary, and used recursive backtracking to generate all possible combinations of letters in the boggle board. the speed of this approach came in 6th place out of approximately 65 students.
