#Project 4: /dev/dice#

Standard UNIX and Linux systems come with a few special files like /dev/zero, which returns nothing but zeros when it is read, and /dev/random, which returns random bytes. In this project, you will write a device driver to create a new device, /dev/dice which returns a randomly selected roll of a 6-sided die.
