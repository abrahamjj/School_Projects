#Project 1: RPS Game & EXIF Tag Viewer#

part1: For the first part of this project, you will be implementing the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.<br />
part2: An EXIF tag is embedded in many image files taken on a digital camera to add metadata about the camera and exposure. It is a complicated format, but we can simplify it to where we can write a simple viewer that will work with many JPEG files.<br />
