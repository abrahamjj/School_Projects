#Assignment 1: Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem Implementation#

The objective of this assignment is to implement the Merkle-Hellman Knapsack cryptosystem algorithm
The program accepts up to 80 characters of text at a time.

Part1 is a simple implementation of a generic doubly linked list meant for practice.<br />
Part2 is the implementation of the Merkle-Hellman Knapsack algorithm.

to compile and run the program in Part2 type the following into the terminal:

javac *.java <br />
java MerkleHellmanKnapsack

and to view the Javadocs for the classes go the Javadoc directory created for each class file
and open the file titled "index.html" in a web browser.
